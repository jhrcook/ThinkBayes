    "The **odds in favor** of an event are the ratio of the probability it will occur to the probability that it will not. For example, if a team has a 75% chance of winning, their odds of winning are $0.75/0.25 = (\\frac{3}{4})/(\\frac{1}{4}) = \\frac{3}{1} = 3:1$, i.e. \"three to one odds\". We often use the expression \"**odds against**\" an event is when the probability of the event is low, and the equation is flipped. If the team had a 10% chance of winning, then the odds against them would be $0.9/0.1 = 9:1$, i.e. \"nine to one odds against.\"\n",

In other words, if we choose two random people from the population, what is the chance of finding one with type 'O' and one with type 'AB'? The two combinations could be a type 'O' and type 'AB' pair, or a type 'AB' and type 'O' person. Thus, the probability is $(0.6)(0.01) + (0.01)(0.6) = 1.2\\%$.\n",
